# Sandpack NPM CDN

ðŸš§ This project is experimental so there should definitely always be a fallback to `unpkg`/`jsdelivr` until this project has a reliable test suite and deploy strategy.

The sandpack cdn is used to speedup SandPack's transpilation of node_modules by having a central server/cdn that pre-transpiles every node_module it requests with the aim to return a slimmed down version of the requested npm module, so that sandpack should not do any additional requests nor transpile any node_module code itself.

## Testing the CDN

Some good packages to test the CDN:

- No exports: `react@17.0.2`
- Conditional root exports: `framer@1.3.6`
- Relative and wildcard exports: `framer@2.0.0-beta.13`
- Array exports: `@babel/runtime@7.16.5`

## Running the project

Run the following command: `RUST_MIN_STACK=16777216 cargo run`
